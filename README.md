# Anticipate Car Accident using RNN with Dynamic Soft Attention

- Re-imple the model based on the paper <Anticipating Accidents in Dashcam Videos>
- ref: https://github.com/smallcorgi/Anticipating-Accidents
- Train RNN(LSTM) model with soft attention mechnism
- Anticipate the car accident in dashcam videos with attention to objects

# Current Situation
- Re imple the model with RNN
- Variate the base models (e.g. Yolo for OD)

# To Do
- future work: change the architecture to transformer-based model or utilize segmentation + point Tracking in 3D space
